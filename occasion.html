  <p class="main-paragraph">
  If your pet is travelling with you, then you can order a travel size version of the regular meal package your pet is taking. The travel package contains no-liquid food (so that you can easily pass the security check), paper bowls (fold it into a bowl to put your food in, easily recyclable) and even treats that are adjusted with add-in natural ingredients to reduce your pets' travel stress and increase their immune system.
