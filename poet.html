 <p>
 	And you taught me what this feels like.
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then how it feels to lose it.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you showed me who I wanted.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then who I wasn't.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you ticked every box.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then drew a line.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you weren't mine to begin with.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then not to end with.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you looked like everything I wanted.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then became something I hated.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you get thought of every day.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then not in a good way.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you let me leave.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And then wish I'd stayed.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
And you almost killed me.
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	...
 	<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
But I didn't die ...
<br>
 	<br>
 	<br>
