 <p> This is a website written in French, although I can not read it, therefore takes some effort to fully understand which tab is for what function. Nevertheless I really love the graphic design of it. The moving and interactive large screen of 3-D structure in the middle of the website is super fun to play with, it gives the webiste a vivid life. The layout of this website is in the style I love, minimalistic, chic and clean. </p>
