    As an online-only brand, we have an excellent delivery system supports us. When you place your order before 12pm, we deliver your package to your doorsteps on the same business day (like postmates for your pets!) When you place your order anytime after 12pm, we deliver it to you the next day. Your order will be placed in a temperature-controlled container (with/without dry ice) to make sure you get the freshest meals. NYC and NJ area only for now. We will expand our service very soon.
