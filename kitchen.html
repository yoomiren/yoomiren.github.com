  <p class="main-paragraph">
   Each morning, fresh ingredients are delivered to our kitchen. Our kitchen stuff handpick, prepare and cook everything with our own recipes. Wheather it's grain-free, high protein or special diet, we all make sure the meal is healthy and tasteful. We believe pets should eat real food, not some unknown paste that is stuffed in a can. Therefore, when you open the meal package, you would see all the ingredients and name them out.
